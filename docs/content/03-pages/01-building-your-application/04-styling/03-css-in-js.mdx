It's possible to use any existing CSS-in-JS solution. The simplest one is inline styles:

```jsx
function HiThere() {
  return <p style={{ color: "red" }}>hi there</p>;
}

export default HiThere;
```

We bundle [styled-jsx](https://github.com/vercel/styled-jsx) to provide support for isolated scoped CSS.
The aim is to support "shadow CSS" similar to Web Components, which unfortunately [do not support server-rendering and are JS-only](https://github.com/w3c/webcomponents/issues/71).

See the above examples for other popular CSS-in-JS solutions (like Styled Components).

A component using `styled-jsx` looks like this:

```jsx
function HelloWorld() {
  return (
    <div>
      Hello world
      <p>scoped!</p>
      <style jsx>{`
        p {
          color: blue;
        }
        div {
          background: red;
        }
        @media (max-width: 600px) {
          div {
            background: blue;
          }
        }
      `}</style>
      <style global jsx>{`
        body {
          background: black;
        }
      `}</style>
    </div>
  );
}

export default HelloWorld;
```

Please see the [styled-jsx documentation](https://github.com/vercel/styled-jsx) for more examples.

### Disabling JavaScript

Yes, if you disable JavaScript the CSS will still be loaded in the production build (`next start`). During development, we require JavaScript to be enabled to provide the best developer experience with [Fast Refresh](https://nextjs.org/blog/next-9-4#fast-refresh).
