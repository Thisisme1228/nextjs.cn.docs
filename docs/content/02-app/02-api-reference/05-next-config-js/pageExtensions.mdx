description: Extend the default page extensions used by Next.js when resolving pages in the Pages Router.

{/* The content of this doc is shared between the app and pages router. You can use the `<PagesOnly>Content</PagesOnly>` component to add content that is specific to the Pages Router. Any shared content should not be wrapped in a component. */}

By default, Next.js accepts files with the following extensions: `.tsx`, `.ts`, `.jsx`, `.js`. This can be modified to allow other extensions like markdown (`.md`, `.mdx`).

```js filename="next.config.js"
const withMDX = require("@next/mdx")();

/** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */
const nextConfig = {
  pageExtensions: ["js", "jsx", "ts", "tsx", "md", "mdx"],
};

module.exports = withMDX(nextConfig);
```
